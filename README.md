# Ascio-Hostbill domain registrar plugin

##Installation instructions

Copying the files to the Hostbill directory

* Place all files in the Hostbill includes/modules/Domain directory

Working with GIT

* You can't checkout directly into the Domain directory because it is not empty
* You can rename the Domain directory, checkout into Domain, and add copy the old module files into it, in case you want to keep connected with GIT. 

Unfortunatly I see no easier way of deploying it. Either copying the files, or making the Domains directory the GIT root.
