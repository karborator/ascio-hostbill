# Ascio Hostbill registrar-plugin
## Plugin for registering domains with Hostbill via the Ascio registrar

Hostbill Ascio Plugin 

* Place all files in the Hostbill includes/modules/Domain directory
* You can't checkout directly into the Domain directory because it is not empty
* You can rename the Domain directory, checkout into Domain, and add copy the old module files into it, in case you want to keep connected with GIT. 

Unfortunatly I see no easier way of deploying it. Either copying the files, or making the Domains directory the GIT root. 

Most TLD settings are in hostbill. If something is missing please ask me.
If you have improvement please commit. I'm happy about any help.
